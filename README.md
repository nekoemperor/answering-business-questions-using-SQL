## About:
In this project, we'll work with data from the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/), a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. We'll use SQL in Jupyter Notebook to analyze data from this database.

## Note:
The Factbook contains demographic information like the following:

- population — the global population.
- population_growth — the annual population growth rate, as a percentage.
- area — the total land and water area.

## Technologies:
Project is created with:
* Jupyter Notebook
* SQL
